// Fix the regex so that it checks for the names of Franklin Roosevelt or Eleanor Roosevelt in a case sensitive manner and it should
//  make concessions for middle names.
// Then fix the code so that the regex that you have created is checked against myString and either true or false
//  is returned depending on whether the regex matches.
//Franklin Roosevelt, Eleanor Roosevelt
let myString = "Franklin D. Roosevelt";
let myRegex = /(Franklin|Eleanor).*Roosevelt/g; // Change this line
let result = myString.match(myRegex); // Change this line
// After passing the challenge experiment with myString and see how the grouping works
console.log(result)
