//what? - recursion is a problem solving technique where the solution depnds on solutioons to smaller 
//instances of the same problem, i.e where a function calls itself

// why? - a great technique to simplify your solution

// points - 
        // every recursive solution needs a base case to terminate recursion
        // just because it may simplify answer, does not mean its faster
        // recursion is not the straightforward to understand, its difficult.
